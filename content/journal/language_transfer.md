[Language Transfer](https://www.languagetransfer.org) is an incredible project
by Mihalis Eleftheriou to teach not only languages but a method of learning.


First off, the [free courses](https://www.languagetransfer.org/courses) are
excellent. The recordings are available on the web, but the content is also
available through
[Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/language-transfer/id1519599004) and
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.languagetransfer)
apps.

I've personally only completed the German cource, but I intend to complete the
Spanish and French courses as well.

I think these courses exhibit a few important aspects of learning that make
them so effective.

- Student interaction and a call / response methodology to engage students.
- Pausing for reflection and forming connections. In fact it's emphasized to
facilitate active recall of the material.
- Repetition. Returning to previous content at appropriate intervals to improve
recall.

These are the core principles used by Mahalis to teach these languages.
