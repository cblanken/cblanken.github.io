Hello there! My name is Cameron and this is my little slice of the internet
where I post about computer science, tech, and my current projects.

My formal degree is a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Computer
Engineering from the University of Louisville. I've previously worked
professionally as a software engineer developing
[HMIs](https://realpars.com/what-is-hmi/) for conveyor systems. I also have
experience with Python, JavaScript, C#, Java, SQL, and Rust. I'm currently
looking to break into freelance web development or find a role as a security
analyst.

If you find any of my ramblings helpful or are interested in any of my
projects, please
[let&nbsp;me&nbsp;know](mailto:contact@cblanken.dev)! I hope
you have a good day and enjoy your time here. Don't forget to be awesome.
